# BIOS 247: Whole-genome Sequencing and Applications: From Yeast to Fruit Flies

This repository contains code and data for Stanford mini-course Bios 247, taught in Summer 2024 by Clare Abreu, Marianna Karageorgi, and Jess Rhodes.

The code folder contains the code to run the whole-genome sequencing pipeline (used here for yeast sequencing).

The data folder contains Sanger sequencing data for Exercise 1 in the Sanger_data subfolder. For whole-genome data, download bam files from this public Dropbox folder: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/mxcm17f1r4fkwk94er5ty/AOcBYNZ_XU3Zc3IkbHlZKQc?rlkey=kcb5u7i8xhtodk9sunlinznji&e=1&st=4bi9l4er&dl=0

The exercises folder contains exercises to be completed in Week 1.
